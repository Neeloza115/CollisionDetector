## Features
- **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)** collision detection  
- **Circle-circle** and **circle-rectangle** intersection checks  
- **Polygon-polygon** intersection logic  
- **JUnit test coverage** for accuracy and edge cases  
- **Modular architecture** for easy integration in games, simulations, or physics engines
